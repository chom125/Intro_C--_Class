// Assignment 6-1
// Let's now complete the banking problem that was specified and designed in Assignment
// 4. First, write the C++ code and classes that implement that design. Next, test
// the program, including boundary conditions, to ensure that it behaves as you (and
// the customer) intended. Overload the ostream operator to support printing
// instances of a customer account to the monitor, a stringstream, or to a file.
