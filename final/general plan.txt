Humanities Classroom

Entrance
Health: 10
You are standing in front of an old, abandoned high school - your old high school. 
Your friends insisted on breaking in and taking a look around, but you stayed behind
because breaking and entering isn't exactly on your bucket list and you had some Amazing Spider-Man
to get through. As you pull your jacket tight around you, you realize that not only can you see your 
breath, but your friends have been gone for almost 2 solid hours. Packing up your comics, you stand up
and consider your options.

1. Check your phone
	text answer "You're a frugal t-mobile user. As such, you find that in a clutch, you have no bars."
2. Go to foyer
3. Read comics
	text answer "The safety of your friends may be up in the air but one thing is certain, Eddy Brock's
	transformation into Venom is a compelling storyline if ever there was one"


Foyer
Health: 10
A foul stench fills the air as you enter McKillian High's central foyer. To your left you see a broken trophy 
display case. Your class was one of the last in the school's 100 year history. The general disrepair of the 
building gives you an odd eternal feeling; as if the exploits of you and your peers have been steeped in 
a space of time several magnitudes more extreme than the intervening years would suggest. While the glass is broken, 
the trophies, photos and keepsakes are mostly in place. You look down into a broken shard of glass and see something 
odd in the reflection; odd enough to make you turn around. A wisp of smoke trails down the hallway of lockers emanating
from Mr. Schlocter's old classroom. 
Go to Mr. Schlocter's Room
Head in the opposite direction, to the gymnasium
Read comics

Gymnasium
The gymnasium is dark and quiet. You experience a strong agoraphobic chill. 
Call out to friends
	You receive only echoes in reply. (Health -2)
Go back to Foyer
Read comics
	It's too dark to read. 

Math Classroom
Health: 8 (maybe)
A young man sits at the front of the classroom, silently engaged with the textbook in front of him. He looks up 
slowly to meet your gaze "Make sure your next steps are calculated carefully, <player name>." Next to the 
sinister student is a glistening mathletes trophy. 
Blindly accept the presence of the specter
	Jump right into math challenge
Question him
	My name is Alistair Rollins, greatest mathlete these halls have ever seen. Back in my day, why a guy
	could letter in math and practically run this place. The algorithmically advanced were top dogs who could
	expect to go to any school they wanted; MIT, Harvard, Yale, you name it. I was gearing up for a full ride
	at Stanford, when I was electrocuted at home while running experimental stress tests with household
	blenders. I've wandered these halls for generations as interest in math has waned." Your phone rings. Alistair
	scowls. 
	Ignore it
		"Sorry" Alistair relaxes a little. "I've wandered these halls for generations while gadgets like that
		beautiful iPhone 5C have proliferated and mathematical prowess has atrophied. I know where your friends are
		and I won't give them to just some techno sap. Prove you're a mathlete...or a mouse"
			 ( 6xy^2 + 60x + 7y^2 ) - ( -7xy^2 + 8x^2 + 6y^2 - 4 )
			 	 13xy^2 - 8x^2 + y^2 + 60x + 4
			 	 	Alistair smiles at you, points to the trophy without breaking his gaze. "Physical fitness is 
			 	 	also in decline. A shame." He then explodes. 
			 	 		Back to Foyer
			 	 			TODO: continue tomorrow
			 	 		Check phone
			 	 		Pick up mathletes trophy (then reduce options to Back to Foyer and Check phone)
			 	 13xy^2 - 6x^2 + 2y^2 + 20x + 4
			 	 	Health -6, then repeat question
			 	 -xy^2 - 6x^2 + 13y^2 + 60x - 4
			 	 	Health -6, then repeat question
			 	 Punch the ghost
			 	 	Health -10
			 	 	You got beat up by a math dork
	Pick it up
		"Chad Wheeler" One of your missing friends
			Answer it
				zaps you health -4, then similar verbiage to ignore it
			Put it back
				zaps you health -2, then similar verbiage to ignore it
