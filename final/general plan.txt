Entrance
You are standing in front of an old, abandoned high school - your old high school. 
Your friends insisted on breaking in and taking a look around, but you stayed behind
because breaking and entering isn't exactly on your bucket list and you had some Amazing Spider-Man
to get through. As you pull your jacket tight around you, you realize that not only can you see your 
breath, but your friends have been gone for almost 2 solid hours. Packing up your comics, you stand up
and consider your options.

1. Check your phone
	text answer "You're a frugal t-mobile user. As such, you find that in a clutch, you have no bars."
2. Go to foyer
3. Read comics
	text answer "The safety of your friends may be up in the air but one thing is certain, Eddy Brock's
	transformation into Venom is a compelling storyline if ever there was one"

Foyer
A foul stench fills the air as you enter McKillian High's central foyer. To your left you see a broken trophy 
display case. Your class was one of the last in the school's 100 year history. The general disrepair of the 
building gives you an odd eternal feeling; as if the exploits of you and your peers have been steeped in 
a space of time several magnitudes more extreme than the intervening years would suggest. While the glass is broken, 
the trophies, photos and keepsakes are mostly in place. Mostly. 
<player should have option to place trophy found in another room>
